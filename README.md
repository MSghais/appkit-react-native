# ⛔️ DEPRECATED 
Please replace this package with https://github.com/WalletConnect/modal-react-native

The only difference between both packages is that we removed `Web3Button` component and changed some component names:


* `useWeb3Modal` -> `useWalletConnectModal`
* `Web3Modal` ->`WalletConnectModal`
